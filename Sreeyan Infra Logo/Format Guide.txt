	Format Guide.txt(This File)

All the different variants are being provided in different formats according to needs:

	EDITABLE
-> SVG – A true vector format that can be edited with Inkscape, Illustrator, CorelDraw, or any other vector graphics application.
-> AI – Another true vector format, only it is proprietary to Adobe, so it can really only used with Illustrator.
-> EPS – This is another editable format, not necessarily a true vector format.
-> PDF – Another editable file that works very similarly to Adobe Illustrator format. The benefit with PDF though is that it’s not proprietary, meaning it can work with any vector graphics software.

	READY TO USE
PNG-> PNGs can be directly uploaded to a website for use as a logo, and since they have a transparent background, they’ll lay nicely on top of whatever color, pattern, image or video is being used as the background.
JPG-> It is a raster format often used for photographs on the web. JPG files are web friendly because the files are typically smaller.
